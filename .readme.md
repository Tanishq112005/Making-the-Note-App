## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
-   Python 3.8+ and pip installed.
-   A running instance of your chosen database (e.g., PostgreSQL).

### **Backend Setup**

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv .venv

    # Activate on Windows
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate

    # Activate on macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your database URL and any other secret keys.
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string"
    SECRET_KEY="your_jwt_secret_key"
    ```

5.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    fastapi dev main.py
    ```
    The backend API will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### **Frontend Setup**

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    # From the root directory
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install the required npm packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The React application will now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is in use).
